# THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS(TOC)

## INTRODUCTION

The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a management philosophy developed by Dr. Eli Goldratt (Author), a theory is based on the principle that any system, whether it is a business, a manufacturing facility, or any other type of organization, is limited by a small number of constraints, or bottlenecks and, the key to improving the performance of a system is to identify and manage these constraints.

Goldratt's Theory of Constraints builds on the concept that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. In business operations where each process involves a series of steps, the slowest step controls the pace of the whole flow of the process.

### Some of the key concepts in TOC include;-

**The idea of "throughput".**
Defined as the rate at which a system produces money through sales. According to TOC, the goal of a business should be to maximize throughput while minimizing inventory and operational expenses. This is achieved by identifying and managing constraints, and by implementing policies and procedures that focus on increasing throughput.

**the idea of "buffer management".**
The process of managing the resources available to a system in order to ensure that the system can continue to operate effectively, even when faced with unexpected changes or disruptions. By managing buffers, businesses can ensure that they have the resources they need to continue operating, even when faced with unexpected changes or disruptions.

**The importance of "flow" in a system.**
Referring to the smooth flow of materials, information, and resources through a system. By ensuring that materials, information, and resources flow smoothly through a system, businesses can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations.
