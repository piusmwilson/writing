# Storytelling | Folktales, folklores and rich history from Africa and around.

From a very young age we are conditioned and learn how to enjoy stories for pleasure, education and also use them make sense of the world and ourselves. As children we grow up participating in story-based activities adapted for different ages and abilities.

Stories have a special place and value, making storytelling universal to the human experience. Although it is likely impossible to prove, it has been suggested that storytelling developed not long after the development of language itself.

Nonetheless, the beauty within storytelling begins with knowing the story and your audience.

## Introduction

It is human nature to tell stories and inform others of our life events and as such, Storytelling, is an intrinsic human characteristic whether imaginative, factual or fictional.

Traditional, Storytelling was how history was created and developed most commonly by way of oral tradition, folklore/tales passage from the older generation to younger generation.

The evolution of storytelling through generations reflects how people learn and communicate and tas such, through oral storytelling or written storytelling, the voice of narration will always have a way place and purpose.

Even though the storytelling mediums have changed over the years, the core concept of using a sequence of events in an exciting narrative has remained the same as the new generation continues to take bigger and bolder steps to create a digital social aspect of storytelling in the modern world.

## What is storytelling?

Storytelling is the social, cultural, religious or even business activity of sharing, telling or writing stories, or narratives sometimes with improvisation, theatrics or embellishment. The term "storytelling" is often imagined to refer specifically to oral storytelling but over the years has also broadly come to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.

Typically, stories are told for entertainment, for informational purposes, or for educational purposes.

Every culture has its own stories or narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values.
> _"Storytelling is the act of telling stories, which are narratives with a beginning, middle, and end."_ — [Storytelling, National Geographic-Education.](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/storytelling-x/)

There are many ways to communicate through storytelling e.g., oral storytelling, visual storytelling, written storytelling, digital storytelling, musical storytelling, dance storytelling, Transmedia Storytelling, Video Storytelling, Data Storytelling and many more depending on the industry, who you interact with and what project you are engaged in.
Storytelling in its purest form predates writing as it intertwined with the development of mythologies through folktales and folklore. 

> Some of the earliest evidence of stories comes from the cave drawings in Lascaux and Chavaux, France. The drawings, which date as far back as 30,000 years ago, depict animals, humans, and other objects. Some of them appear to represent visual stories. - [NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ENCYCLOPEDIC ENTRY](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/storytelling-x/)

Simply put, the earliest forms of storytelling were usually oral, combined with gestures and expressions.

## A brief History of Storytelling

Like all forms of history, it is not easy to pinpoint the earliest forms of storytelling considering recorded entries will only depict information based on when it was discovered, offered up of recording, the person recording these records and often what can be found from a community/Society over what is really factual since the beginning of civilization.

Some archaeologists believe that rock art, in addition to a role in religious rituals, may have served as a form of storytelling for many ancient cultures. Today storytelling is as good as the storyteller and in some cases whoever cares to cary out background checks.

> _"Storytelling is as old as culture. Many societies have long-established storytelling traditions. The stories, and performances thereof, function to entertain as well as educate."_ —[Storytelling and Cultural Traditions](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/storytelling-and-cultural-traditions/)

Storytelling uses words to create new worlds and experiences in a reader or listener's imagination. It can impact human emotions and also lead people to accept original ideas or encourage them to take action as suggested or intended by the storyteller or storytelling purpose.

Since storytelling can take so many forms, creating a good story can be challenging. But great Storytelling include;- **People**, **Place**, **Plot** & **Purpose** as well as _Circumstances, Curiosity, Characters, Conversations, Conflicts, Conclusions_ and _Crisis_ with the main "thick" of a good story being _**The Conflict**, **The Characters** and **The Climax**_.

## What is a story then?! | The aesthetics of artful Storytelling

In his best-selling book Story: _Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting_, published in 1997 by Harper-Collins, McKee argues that stories “fulfill a profound human need to grasp the patterns of living—not merely as an intellectual exercise, but within a very personal, emotional experience.”
Therefore a story, should skillfully intrigue the minds of the audience as well as captivate their hearts along the way.
Because people are not inspired to act by reason alone, storytelling is a powerful way—of uniting an idea with an emotion using compelling stories. In a story, you arouse your listener’s emotions and energy through weaving a bits and pieces of information using artful storytelling.

With rationality and a bit of creativity, anyone can design an argument using conventional rhetoric, but it demands vivid insight and storytelling skill to present ideas that create the emotional power to be memorable. If you can harness imagination and the principles of a well-told story, then you get people rising to their feet amid thunderous applause instead of yawning and ignoring you.

“_All great storytellers since the dawn of time—from the ancient Greeks through Shakespeare and up to the present day—have dealt with this fundamental conflict between subjective expectation and cruel reality._” — [**Bronwyn Fryer**](https://hbr.org/search?term=bronwyn%20fryer&search_type=search-all), [_Storytelling That Moves People_](https://hbr.org/2003/06/storytelling-that-moves-people).

Every Storyteller should naturally try to frame experiences in a compelling story, thus moving an audience through telling a good story by resisting this impulse but rather, embracing it. Captivating stories often leave audiences wanting more thus creating room for dialogue & future interactions.


A big part of a storyteller’s job is to motivate his or her audience towards a certain goal (Build curiosity, spotlight characters, gear towards a climax/conversation or conclusion) to mention but a few. And to do that, A storyteller must engage the emotions of the audience, and the key to their hearts is breadth of the story.

> “Self-knowledge is the root of all great storytelling. A storyteller creates all characters from the self by asking the question, “If I were this character in these circumstances, what would I do?” The more you understand your own humanity, the more you can appreciate the humanity of others in all their good-versus-evil struggles.” — [**Bronwyn Fryer**](https://hbr.org/search?term=bronwyn%20fryer&search_type=search-all), [_Storytelling That Moves People_](https://hbr.org/2003/06/storytelling-that-moves-people).

## The 7 Elements of Good Storytelling according to Aristotle.

Aristotle’s seven elements of good storytelling helps us empathise with the people we design for by asking the right questions. Asking the right questions will help us understand and tell the most essential stories about our users’ needs, motivations, and problems. Aristotle’s points can also show us how storytelling can help increase empathy in a Design Thinking project.

### Plot

The **When, where, what** — What are the character(s) doing? What are they trying to accomplish? The story plot tells us about a person’s change in fortune (either from good to bad, or from bad to good), and is usually about overcoming some kind of obstacle or challenge. In a Design Thinking project, the story plot tells us about struggles and how people try to improve aspects of their lives.

### Character

Who are the people? What are their traits, their personalities? What are their backgrounds, needs, aspirations, and emotions? Who are the protagonists of your story? Focus on looks, character and personality. Be descriptive, but use less information than in writing so as to trigger the imagination of your audience and you can add more details of the characters as your speech advances.

For examples, Storytelling in Design Thinking, most obviously, relates to gaining an empathic understanding of the people for whom we are designing.

When we tell stories about our users, it is not sufficient to know facts about them, like their appearances or income; for a fully fleshed out character, we need insights into their needs, motivations, and emotions.

### Theme

A speech with a theme is a better speech, and a story with a theme is a better story. Use themes for your stories. The theme of a story tells us the overarching obstacle that needs to be crossed, or the end goal of the project. Use a theme to help keep yourself focused and provide your team with a strong narrative to keep you going.

### Dialogue

When you write, you write for the eyes of the reader. When you speak, you speak to the ears of the audience and a great way to speak to the ears is to relive real dialogs with other people. Dialogs enliven and energize your speech.

What are the people saying? Do they say different things when you observe them as compared to when you interview them? Are they angry, disappointed, sad, or happy? While observing their dialogue, are you losing focus on the things they did not say? It is also crucial to keep track of how we, the observers, speak to the people we are observing.

Having a superior or condescending tone when conversing with our users is a sure way to get their guards up and put a limit on how much we can learn from them.

### Melody/Chorus

To be effective, your stories should have a chorus that resonates with your emotions and convictions. The power of storytelling often lies in its ability to stir emotion and motivate us to find a solution.

### Décor

Décor is about the setting. It’s about the physical environment in which your characters perform their acts. What’s the décor, setting, and physical environment in which your users perform their acts like? Effective storytelling does not ignore the setting, because often the interactions between characters and the set will tell us a lot about their motivations and behaviours. As a design thinker, you should pay attention to the opportunities or obstacles present in your users’ environments.

### Spectacle

Are there any plot twists in your stories? Any unexpected insights about your users? The spectacle is something that the audiences who listen to your story will remember, and will generate discussions and ideas. If your design thinking story includes a spectacle, it will be a powerful tool to drive the project forward

Humans love stories, whether we know consciously & subconsciously.
Good stories have the ability to make us laugh, put us in a state of fright, cry, teach us empathy, take us on terrific journeys, educate us, keep culture-religion alive, or comfort us. Like magic, stories are capable of creating worlds, emotions, new ideas and make mundane everyday life seem incredible.

## What makes a good story? | The principles of good storytelling according to Les Brown

1. The purpose of stories is to distract, dispute and inspire.
2. Stories can be used to take a person on a journey within themselves to places where they can never go by themselves.
3. A master story teller creates and masters a variety of strategic experiential communication methodologies that give people a vision of themselves beyond their mental conditioning and their present circumstances.
4. The power of a story is fueled by the energy of you. You are behind the words you speak - this energy creates life changing moments for the listeners.
5. The real power of stories lies in their ability to expand the mind, unlock the heart and ignite the spirit.
6. The best stories allow listeners to develop optimism and hope to live out of their imagination instead of locking them in the past within their failure or their fears.
7. The key to becoming a powerful storyteller is to train with an accomplished coach who has the expertise in extracting stories, facilitating transformative shifts, and creating a thirst for a new life, while at the same time, providing value to an audience.

> _“How people live their lives is a result of the stories that they believe about themselves."_ - Les Brown.
