# Storytelling

## Introduction

It is human nature to tell stories and inform others of our life events and as such, Storytelling, is an intrinsic human characteristic whether imaginative, factual or fictional. 

Traditional, Storytelling was how history was created and developed most commonly by way of oral tradition, folklore/tales passage from the older generation to younger generation.

The evolution of storytelling through generations reflects how people learn and communicate and tas such, through oral storytelling or written storytelling, the voice of narration will always have a way place and purpose.

Even though the storytelling mediums have changed over the years, the core concept of using a sequence of events in an exciting narrative has remained the same as the new generation continues to take bigger and bolder steps to create a digital social aspect of storytelling in the modern world.


## What is storytelling?

Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, sometimes with improvisation, theatrics or embellishment. Every culture has its own stories or narratives, 
which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values.[1] Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, 
characters and narrative point of view. 
The term "storytelling" can refer specifically to oral storytelling but also broadly to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.

Storytelling is the act of telling or writing stories, or narratives. Typically, stories are told for entertainment, for informational purposes, or for educational purposes.

Storytelling is universal to the human experience. Indeed, although it is likely impossible to prove, it has been suggested that storytelling developed not long after the development of language itself.


## A brief History of Storytelling

Like all forms of history, it is not easy to pinpoint the earliest forms of storytelling considering recorded entries will only depict information based on when it was discovered, offered up of recording, the person recording these records and often what can be found from a community/Society over what is really factual since the beginning of civilization.

Today storytelling is as good as the storyteller and in some cases whoever cares to cary out background checks.

> Some of the earliest evidence of stories comes from the cave drawings in Lascaux and Chavaux, France. The drawings, which date as far back as 30,000 years ago, depict animals, humans, and other objects. Some of them appear to represent visual stories. - [NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ENCYCLOPEDIC ENTRY](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/storytelling-x/)



Storytelling, intertwined with the development of mythologies,[2] predates writing. The earliest forms of storytelling were usually oral, combined with gestures and expressions.

Some archaeologists[which?] believe that rock art, in addition to a role in religious rituals, may have served as a form of storytelling for many[quantify] ancient cultures.
Storytelling uses words to create new worlds and experiences in a reader or listener's imagination. Storytelling can impact human emotions and can also lead people
to accept original ideas or encourage them to take action. Since storytelling can take so many forms, creating a good story can be challenging.
