# Protecting Intellectual Property

## Introduction

Even though the Ugandan law protects intellectual property rights, most of the laws aimed at preventing piracy and the distribution of counterfeit goods are yet to be effectively enforced government and while the [URSB]() provides a standardized process for registering each type of intellectual property and allows investors to enforce their rights through the court system, enforcement remains weak.

Uganda signed the [World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO)](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html) Patent Law Treaty in 2000 but has yet to ratify it. 

In August 2021, Uganda did adopt the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO)’s draft protocol on regional voluntary registration of Copyright and Related Rights.  The Protocol was adopted by ARIPO member countries with the aim of ensuring African creators benefit from their creative works.

I have included some interesting reading resources i found while research Intellectual Property management in Uganda.
