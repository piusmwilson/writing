# SYSTEMS THINKING

Exploring the process of analyzing how a system's different components interrelate and how systems work within the context of other bigger systems

Focus Areas: How Systems Thinking applies to ``Sports``, ``Business``, ``Management``, ``Systems & Software Development``

## Introduction

We often look too closely at a things, topics, ideas or even people without considering the complexities, relationships, and implications surrounding them. In fact It’s easy to see things when we’re close to them without having to think to deeply about them, but it takes/requires a purposeful effort, a focused mindset, strategic thinking, and perspective on problem-solving to take a step back and look at the bigger picture of things.

To understand Systems Thinking, we need to approach everything with a big-picture thinker, dreamer, or strategist's mindset due to the curiosity, courage, and the willingness it takes to challenge and question everything and anything. With this mindset, you identify, notice or observe the details of every situation in a large network of complex systems and their larger ecosystems.

## What is a System

A system is a set of interacting elements that together make up a whole so that this whole is greater than the sum of the elements. Any system has its own functions, properties, structure, laws of interaction, development, and other parameters. In order for system thinking to help us solve problems and make decisions, we need to learn to see the world as the interaction of systems.

The world is a complex system with numerous subsystems and suprasystems. All parts of the system that ensure the required functioning of the system are called subsystems. Everything that is not a subsystem, but interacts with the system, is called a suprasystem. A person, a state, an army, a car, currency, education, social networks, business — all these are systems.

For example, a car is a system. The engine, transmission, wheels, suspension are subsystems, and the driver, road and cargo are suprasystems.

## Methodologies of systems thinking

Systems thinking uses computer simulation and a variety of diagrams and graphs to model, illustrate, and predict system behavior. Among the systems thinking tools include the following:

The behavior over time (BOT) graph, which indicates the actions of one or more variables over a period of time.
The causal loop diagram (CLD), which illustrates the relationships between system elements.
The management flight simulator, which uses an interactive program to simulate the effects of management decisions.
The simulation model, which simulates the interaction of system elements over time.

## History of systems thinking

Systems thinking originated in 1956 when Professor Jay Forrester founded the Systems Dynamic Group at MIT's Sloan School of Management.

## The 6 Fundamental Concepts of Systems Thinking

interconnectedness, synthesis, emergence, feedback loops, causality, and systems mapping.

## System Theory

[Systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) is the transdisciplinary study of systems. The fundamental concept of systems theory is that the whole system is greater than the totality of its parts. 

## Systems Thinking

Systems thinking is based on the idea that all key processes in an organization are interrelated. A system is a set of components that work together as a whole to achieve a common goal. A system is greater than the sum of its constituent components because the relationship between the different components adds value to the system. The definition of systems thinking states that it is a cohesive approach that views all subsystems as parts of an overall system, rather than in isolation or as segments.

## What is Systems Thinking

Systems thinking is a holistic analysis approach that explores how the different parts of a system interrelate and how systems work within and outside the context of other, larger or smaller systems.

Systems thinking is used in many areas of research, as it analyzes a variety of operational systems, such in domains like medicine, sports, politics, economics, society, culture, religion, technology, management and education to mention but a few.

It is a way of trying to make sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of systems, subsystems, supra system and their relationships from _large-to-small_ or _small-to-large_ instead of splitting & examining them in parts.

systems thinking is about seeing things with an open mind, and recognizing their interconnectedness. It helps us be better prepared to solve complex problems.

Systems thinking is a holistic approach to analysis that focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems.

Systems thinking is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts. It has been used as a way of exploring and developing effective action in complex contexts, enabling systems change.

Systems thinking can be used in any area of research and has been applied to the study of medical, environmental, political, economic, human resources, and educational systems, among many others.

## Systems Thinking Approach

The systems thinking approach analyzes how the component under study interacts with the other constituents of the system. Systems thinking provides a broad perspective as it works by expanding its view to consider a large number of interactions among structures, patterns, and cycles. Systems thinking provides the means by which interconnections can be recognized as the whole system is viewed. This allows for the understanding of how subsystems relate to the entire system. Along with interconnectedness, systems thinking is also comprised of feedback loops. Feedback loops provide insight into cause-effect relationships between subsystems in the overall system. This cause-effect relationship is referred to as causality. When mapping out at what causes what to happen in a system, the process of systems mapping is being utilized. The systems map can serve not only as a visual representation of the cause-effect relationship, but also as an analysis of the causality.

## Why is Systems Thinking Important

Systems thinking is important because it allows researchers to recognize parts of a system to the whole system. This is commonly referred to as induction. Alternatively, systems thinking can also aid in helping researchers understand the whole system and, as a result, the parts that make up that system. This is known as deduction. Utilizing an inductive approach or deductive approach will depend on the learning style of the researcher.

Systems thinking helps expand the range of options available for solving a problem by broadening thinking and helping researchers articulate problems in new and different ways. This can be very advantageous in that it makes systems thinking very effective when dealing with difficult types of problems that need solutions. Systems thinking is highly beneficial when dealing with complex issues

## Systems Thinking in Business

As previously stated, systems thinking focuses on the concept that all key processes in an organization are interrelated. In business, systems thinking integrates the personal goals of the individual employees with the overall goal of the organization. The systems thinking approach in business consists of analyzing individual decisions based on their systematic consequences.

## Systems Thinking Model

In systems thinking, the analogy of an iceberg is used. The iceberg model is a tool for systems thinking as it depicts what can be seen near the top of the water as observable and what lies far beneath the surface as unobservable. These unobservable elements often cause the observable elements. As pictured below, there is an iceberg. The part of the iceberg under the sea can be divided into four levels: events, patterns, structures, and models. These levels are ordered in such a way that going deeper, or lower, on the iceberg is indicative of a better understanding of the phenomenon or problem at hand.
