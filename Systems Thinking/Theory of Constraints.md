# THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS(TOC)

## INTRODUCTION

The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a management philosophy developed by Dr. Eli Goldratt (Author), based on the principle that any system, whether it is a business, a manufacturing facility, or any other type of organization, is limited by a small number of constraints, or bottlenecks and, the key to improving the performance of a system is to identify and manage these constraints.

Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt conceived the Theory of Constraints (TOC), and introduced it to a wide audience through his bestselling 1984 novel, “The Goal”. Since then, TOC has continued to evolve and develop, as a significant factor within the world of management best practices.

## WHAT IS THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS?

The Theory of Constraints is a methodology for identifying the most important limiting factor (i.e., constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal and then systematically improving that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor.

Theory of Constraints builds on the concept that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. In business operations where each process involves a series of steps, the slowest step controls the pace of the whole flow of the process.

Theory of Constraints inherently prioritizes improvement activities and the top priority is always the current constraint.

## The Basics of Theory Of Constraints(TOC)

The core concept of the Theory of Constraints follows that, every process has a single constraint and the total process throughput can only be improved when the constraint is improved. Therefore, spending time optimizing non-constraints doesn't provide significant benefits thus only improvements to the constraint matter.

TOC seeks to provide precise and sustained focus on improving the current constraint until it no longer limits throughput, at which point the focus moves to the next constraint. The underlying power of TOC flows from its ability to generate a tremendously strong focus towards a single goal (profit) and to removing the principal impediment (the constraint) to achieving more of that goal. In fact, Goldratt considers focus to be the essence of TOC.

## THE NATURE OF CONSTRAINTS | What are Constraints

Every process has a constraint (bottleneck) and focusing improvement efforts on that constraint is the fastest and most effective path to improved profitability.

Constraints are anything that prevents the organization from making progress towards its goal. In manufacturing processes, constraints are often referred to as bottlenecks.

 The Theory of Constraints takes a scientific approach to improvement. It hypothesizes that every complex system, including manufacturing processes, consists of multiple linked activities, one of which acts as a constraint upon the entire system

The ultimate goal of most manufacturing companies is to make a profit – both in the short term and in the long term. 

The Theory of Constraints provides a powerful set of tools for helping to achieve that goal, including:

**The Five Focusing Steps:** a methodology for identifying and eliminating constraints
**The Thinking Processes:** tools for analyzing and resolving problems
**Throughput Accounting:** a method for measuring performance and guiding management decisions

### The Five Focusing Steps**

The Theory of Constraints provides a specific methodology for identifying and eliminating constraints, referred to as the Five Focusing Steps. 
The Five Focusing Steps (POOGI)
**Focusing Step #1:** IDENTIFY the system's constraint.
**Focusing Step #2:** EXPLOIT the constraint.
**Focusing Step #3:** SUBORDINATE everything else to the constraint.
**Focusing Step #4:** ELEVATE the constraint.
**Focusing Step #5:** PREVENT INERTIA from becoming the constraint!

### The Thinking Processes

The Theory of Constraints includes a sophisticated problem solving methodology called the Thinking Processes. The Thinking Processes are optimized for complex systems with many interdependencies (e.g., manufacturing lines). They are designed as scientific “cause and effect” tools, which strive to first identify the root causes of undesirable effects (referred to as UDEs), and then remove the UDEs without creating new ones.

The Thinking Processes are used to answer the following three questions, which are essential to TOC:

What needs to be changed?
What should it be changed to?
What actions will cause the change?

### Throughput Accounting

Throughput Accounting is an alternative accounting methodology that attempts to eliminate harmful distortions introduced from traditional accounting practices – distortions that promote behaviors contrary to the goal of increasing profit in the long term.

In traditional accounting, inventory is an asset (in theory, it can be converted to cash by selling it). This often drives undesirable behavior at companies – manufacturing items that are not truly needed. Accumulating inventory inflates assets and generates a “paper profit” based on inventory that may or may not ever be sold (e.g., due to obsolescence) and that incurs cost as it sits in storage. The Theory of Constraints, on the other hand, considers inventory to be a liability – inventory ties up cash that could be used more productively elsewhere.

In traditional accounting, there is also a very strong emphasis on cutting expenses. The Theory of Constraints, on the other hand, considers cutting expenses to be of much less importance than increasing throughput. Cutting expenses is limited by reaching zero expenses, whereas increasing throughput has no such limitations.

These and other conflicts result in the Theory of Constraints emphasizing Throughput Accounting, which uses as its core measures: Throughput, Investment, and Operating Expense.

### Some of the key concepts in TOC include;-

**The idea of "throughput".**
Defined as the rate at which a system produces money through sales. According to TOC, the goal of a business should be to maximize throughput while minimizing inventory and operational expenses. This is achieved by identifying and managing constraints, and by implementing policies and procedures that focus on increasing throughput.

**the idea of "buffer management".**
The process of managing the resources available to a system in order to ensure that the system can continue to operate effectively, even when faced with unexpected changes or disruptions. By managing buffers, businesses can ensure that they have the resources they need to continue operating, even when faced with unexpected changes or disruptions.

**The importance of "flow" in a system.**
Referring to the smooth flow of materials, information, and resources through a system. By ensuring that materials, information, and resources flow smoothly through a system, businesses can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations.


## About the Author

_Eliyahu Moshe Goldratt (March 31, 1947 – June 11, 2011) was an Israeli business management guru.He was the originator of the Optimized Production Technique, the Theory of Constraints (TOC), the Thinking Processes, Drum-Buffer-Rope, Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) and other TOC derived tools._

Eliyahu M. Goldratt was an educator, author, physicist, philosopher and business leader, but first and foremost, he was a thinker who provoked others to think. Often characterized as unconventional, stimulating, and “a slayer of sacred cows,” he urged his audience to examine and reassess their business practices with a fresh, new vision.

Dr. Goldratt was born in Israel on March 31, 1947, into a rabbinic family, the son of Avraham-Yehuda Goldrat. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from Tel Aviv University and a Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy from Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel.

He is the founder of TOC for Education, a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing TOC Thinking and TOC tools to teachers and their students, and Goldratt Consulting. In addition to his pioneering work in business management and education, Dr. Goldratt holds patents in a number of areas ranging from medical devices to drip irrigation to temperature sensors. 

Dr. Goldratt is best known as the father of the Theory of Constraints (TOC), a process of ongoing improvement that identifies and leverages a system’s constraints in order to achieve the system’s goals. He introduced TOC’s underlying concepts in his business novel, The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement, which has been recognized as one of the best-selling business books of all time. First published in 1984, The Goal has been updated three times and sold more than 7 million copies worldwide. It has been translated into 35 languages.

Heralded as a “guru to industry” by Fortune magazine and “a genius” by Business Week, Dr. Goldratt continued to advance the TOC body of knowledge throughout his life, building on the Five Focusing Steps (the process of ongoing improvement, known as POOGI) with TOC-derived tools such as Drum-Buﬀer-Rope, Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) and the Thinking Processes. He authored ten other TOC-related books, including four business novels: It’s Not Luck (the sequel to The Goal), Critical Chain, Necessary but Not Sufficient and Isn’t It Obvious? His last book, The Choice, was co-authored by his daughter Efrat Ashlang-Goldratt.

Goldratt died from complications arising from lung cancer on June 11, 2011, at noon, in his home in Israel at the age of 64.
