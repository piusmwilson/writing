## Systems

Understanding how systems work must begin with a basic idea of what a system is. We often use the word in everyday interactions in phrases like "intelligent systems" "nervous system," "legal system," "school system," "heating system", "Respiratory system" or even "cooling system." 
Simply put, a system is a collection of parts that interact with each other to function as a whole. Systems are composed of interrelated parts.

When one of these parts is itself a system (i.e., that part consists of two or more interrelated parts), we call the smaller system a subsystem and the larger system its suprasystem. And that larger system, of course, can be a subsystem of a still larger system.

For this reason, one System can be a Piece of Another System.  When one of these parts is itself a system (i.e., that part consists of two or more interrelated parts), we call the smaller system a subsystem and the larger system its suprasystem. And that larger system, of course, can be a subsystem of a still larger system.

## The Hierarchy of Systems

The Hierarchy of Systems In general, any given system is composed of other systems of about the same level, which together comprise the larger system. Thus, a particular protein molecule might contain atoms of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen; an economy is made up of people, land, buildings, machines, plants, dairy herds, and so on; the solar system is made up of the sun, the planets and their moons, and many, many asteroids, comets, and other bits of debris. (Kauffman, 1978).

## Introduction to Complex Systems

Complex systems are all around us, from the bustling streets of a city to the intricate web of life in a forest. But what exactly are complex systems? They are systems comprised of numerous interconnected components that interact in ways that give rise to new and often unexpected behaviors.

In the realm of complex systems, the suprasystem is a crucial concept. It represents a level above smaller systems, where interactions between these smaller systems lead to emergent properties and behaviors at a higher, more comprehensive level. Think of it as a system of systems, where the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.

Suprasystems can be found in various domains, and their understanding is vital to grasp the complexity of our world.

Understanding suprasystems has implications for solving complex global problems like climate change, disease outbreaks, and resource management. It's an exciting frontier for science and innovation.

The prefix supra- refers to what is on something else or is superior. A system , meanwhile, is an ordered set of elements that are interrelated.
In this framework, a suprasystem is called a system that is made up of other systems . This means that a suprasystem (also called a supersystem ) is a larger system made up of smaller systems, which in turn may contain subsystems .


## Suprasystems

A suprasystem, also known as a supersystem, is a system that is made up of other systems; that is, it is a larger system that integrates or contains small systems. These are known as minor systems or subsystems.

Suprasystems usually have a direct influence on the activities that are executed in the systems they host. A practical example of a suprasystem is the human body. This is made up of the digestive system (which would be a subsystem) and, in turn, the digestive system is made up of the stomach (another subsystem).

Another example of a suprasystem is the universe. This is formed by the subsystem of the milky way, and by another subsystem corresponding to the planets.

In general, a suprasystem allows to organize in a hierarchical way a group of organizations that work together for the harmonious operation and the achievement of a common goal.

## Characteristics of a suprasystem

* The suprasystem or supersystem could be understood as the environment or environment for the operation of various systems.

* Suprasystems are divided into complex units that are integrated into it. However, all these units are under his control, as this is the main executor.

* A suprasystem is made up of several systems, while a system can belong to one or more suprasystems.

* Suprasystems are the highest rank in the hierarchy in systems theory. The order from highest to lowest would be suprasystem, system and subsystem.

## Examples of suprasystems

### 1- Business suprasystem

In organizations the existence of suprasystems is very common. In this sense, the company is the main environment where activities are carried out.

The organization is divided into departments. Likewise, the departments are divided into other subsystems, which would be the small departments of one or two employees that fulfill more specific functions.


For example, the accounts payable department is the system; This is made up of the sub-departments of accounts payable to providers and accounts payable to physicians. The latter would be subsystems.

### 2- Continental suprasystem

This suprasystem is made up of the continents. In turn, the continents are divided into countries.

Each country has subsystems called cities and states. They are the smallest division of the supersystem.

An example is South America, which is a subcontinent of America. This subcontinent is classified as a suprasystem since within it there are a series of countries that become a system, because they are also divided into cities.


### 3- Technological suprasystem

A basic example of this supersystem is computers. This is so because the computer in general allows all the integrated components to function; the computer has parts that communicate with each other.


A computer system is the motherboard or motherboard. In this some of the components that participate in the functioning of the suprasystem are connected.

At the same time, this motherboard has a division where the RAM memory is located; there reside programs and main data of the computer. This RAM memory is part of a subsystem.

### 4- Human anatomical suprasystem

The human body is a suprasystem made up of several systems. Some of these are the digestive system, the respiratory system or the circulatory system among others. In this case, the suprasystem could not function or would function with difficulty if any of its systems failed.

### 5- The solar system

The solar system is a suprasystem made up of planets and the sun. In turn, each planet itself forms a system made up of other subsystems.

### 6- Social Systems

One of the most complex forms of a system is the social system. Because these systems are composed of individual human beings--who often in turn comprise one or more levels of subsystems--these systems are also among the most unpredictable. This added dimension of unpredictability leads social systems to have unique types of feedback loops. For example, unlike members or components of nonhuman systems, particular members of a social system may elect to intentionally violate its norms. When this happens, the mechanism that engages to correct this disturbance is a negative feedback loop. This mechanism may simply involve ostracism--or, for more serious offenses, the criminal justice system may become involved. In either case, negative feedback triggers a reaction that acts to isolate the offender, negating the source of the disturbance. Another example comes from a more specific social system: education. Our public educational systems are ultimately accountable to the political mechanism of the society they serve: in a democracy, this may take the form of public election of a school board. In other forms of government, schools may be subject to a governmental review of their curriculum. In either case, if the operation of the school drifts outside the bounds of what is acceptable to the community it serves, its control mechanism acts as a negative feedback loop--detecting this divergence and restoring public accountability.
