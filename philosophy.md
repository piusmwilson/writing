# PHILOSOPHY

Philosophy is a way of thinking about the world, the universe, and society. It works by asking very basic questions about the nature of human thought, the nature of the universe, and the connections between them. The ideas in philosophy are often general and abstract, but we have to break it down and understand it from all angles both Subjective and objective with the help of quantitative and qualitative approaches.

Analytic philosophy, Western philosophy, Modern Philosophy, 

The philosophical search for truth is a never-ending process, evolution in philosophy consists, at least in part, of constantly bringing to light the secret presuppositions that find their way deep into our thought, too deep down for us to be even aware of them. But whatever the origins of these presumptions, of which we are ignorant, they must be brought to light and challenged. These bringing to light is what the advancement of philosophy is.

## PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE

### The Autonomy of Philosophy

### The Authority of Philosophy

### Is science a philosophy

### Is Philosophy and Art or a Science.

### PHILOSOPHY AND COMPUTING

Philosophy has been described as having taken a "computational turn," referring to the ways in which computers and information technology shed new light on traditional philosophic problems, provide new tools and concepts for philosophic reasoning, and present theoretical and practical questions that cannot easily be solved within traditional philosophic frameworks [3], and hence Philosophy of computing is the investigation of the basic nature and principles of computers and the process of computation

the different relations between philosophy and computer science with its ICT applications into four areas:

#### SOCIOLOGY OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY

The term information society has been proposed to refer to the post-industrial society in which information plays a pivotal role and have five characterizations: technological, economic, sociological, spatial, and cultural.

* Technological: this refers to the way the wide-ranging innovations in information and communications, from cable and satellite television, personal computers, to internet has defined a new social order
* Economical: The structure of the economy and its recent changes, in which information has come to play a defining role, has been described to constitute the information economy
* Sociological: Sociologists have conceptualized the information society in terms of changes in occupational structure and consider the preponderance of information work in occupations to have created a new social order
* Spatial: The impact of information networks on the organization of space and time has been the focal point of this discourse, therefore the concept of time shifting and space shifting is gaining place in this century of Globalization
* Cultural: The cultural conception of an information society is closely related to the information environment in which we now live. Access to a wide range of news and analysis, entertainment, personal and community help from across the globe through various media. In this new social order, while there is the freedom of choice with regard to a particular medium, the penetration of some level of information in everyday life has been inevitable

#### THE PHILOSOPHY OF INFORMATION

Philosophy of Information deals with the philosophical analysis of the notion of information both from a historical and a systematic perspective.
According to Anthony, the philosophy of information is merely philosophy concerning information and an attempt to determine what it is in the same sense that the philosophy of science is philosophy concerning science and what it is.

#### THE PHILOSOPHY OF AI (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE)

The philosophy of artificial intelligence is a collection of issues primarily concerned with whether or not AI is possible, with whether or not it is possible to build an intelligent thinking machine [18].
What seems worth anticipating here is that, in the past, the heated debate on the analogies, or even the potential identity, between brains and computers appears to have had the unfortunate counter-effect of keeping a number of philosophers away from other aspects of the digital revolution of equally profound philosophical interest.

#### PHILOSOPHY AND AIDED INTELLIGENCE

Aided intelligence is an alternative conceptualization of artificial intelligence that focuses on AI's assistive role, emphasizing the fact that cognitive technology is designed to enhance human intelligence rather than replace it.
The philosopher may be more interested in the root of actions performed by the aided intelligence in supporting human, and then the nature of these actions.
