# Storytelling | Folktales, folklores and rich history from Africa and around.

Storytelling is universal to the human experience. Indeed, although it is likely impossible to prove, it has been suggested that storytelling developed not long after the development of language itself.

## Introduction

It is human nature to tell stories and inform others of our life events and as such, Storytelling, is an intrinsic human characteristic whether imaginative, factual or fictional.

Traditional, Storytelling was how history was created and developed most commonly by way of oral tradition, folklore/tales passage from the older generation to younger generation.

The evolution of storytelling through generations reflects how people learn and communicate and tas such, through oral storytelling or written storytelling, the voice of narration will always have a way place and purpose.

Even though the storytelling mediums have changed over the years, the core concept of using a sequence of events in an exciting narrative has remained the same as the new generation continues to take bigger and bolder steps to create a digital social aspect of storytelling in the modern world.

## What is storytelling?

Storytelling is the social, cultural, religious or even business activity of sharing, telling or writing stories, or narratives sometimes with improvisation, theatrics or embellishment. The term "storytelling" is often imagined to refer specifically to oral storytelling but over the years has also broadly come to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.

Typically, stories are told for entertainment, for informational purposes, or for educational purposes.

Every culture has its own stories or narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values.
> _"Storytelling is the act of telling stories, which are narratives with a beginning, middle, and end."_ — [Storytelling, National Geographic-Education.](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/storytelling-x/)

There are many ways to communicate through storytelling e.g., oral storytelling, visual storytelling, written storytelling, digital storytelling, musical storytelling, dance storytelling, Transmedia Storytelling, Video Storytelling, Data Storytelling and many more depending on the industry, who you interact with and what project you are engaged in.
Storytelling in its purest form predates writing as it intertwined with the development of mythologies through folktales and folklore. 

> Some of the earliest evidence of stories comes from the cave drawings in Lascaux and Chavaux, France. The drawings, which date as far back as 30,000 years ago, depict animals, humans, and other objects. Some of them appear to represent visual stories. - [NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ENCYCLOPEDIC ENTRY](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/storytelling-x/)

Simply put, the earliest forms of storytelling were usually oral, combined with gestures and expressions.


## A brief History of Storytelling

Like all forms of history, it is not easy to pinpoint the earliest forms of storytelling considering recorded entries will only depict information based on when it was discovered, offered up of recording, the person recording these records and often what can be found from a community/Society over what is really factual since the beginning of civilization.

Some archaeologists believe that rock art, in addition to a role in religious rituals, may have served as a form of storytelling for many ancient cultures. Today storytelling is as good as the storyteller and in some cases whoever cares to cary out background checks.

> _"Storytelling is as old as culture. Many societies have long-established storytelling traditions. The stories, and performances thereof, function to entertain as well as educate."_ —[Storytelling and Cultural Traditions](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/storytelling-and-cultural-traditions/)

Storytelling uses words to create new worlds and experiences in a reader or listener's imagination. It can impact human emotions and also lead people to accept original ideas or encourage them to take action as suggested or intended by the storyteller or storytelling purpose.

Since storytelling can take so many forms, creating a good story can be challenging. But great Storytelling include;- **People**, **Place**, **Plot** & **Purpose** as well as _Circumstances, Curiosity, Characters, Conversations, Conflicts, Conclusions_ and _Crisis_ with the main "thick" of a good story being _**The Conflict**, **The Characters** and **The Climax**_.
