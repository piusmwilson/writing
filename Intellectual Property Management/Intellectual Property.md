## Resource Structure Information

### The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is the global forum for intellectual property poi,icy, services, information and cooperation. WIPO is a self-funding agency of the United Nations, with 193 Member States. Its mission is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international intellec­tual property system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all. WIPO's mandate, gover­ning bodies and procedures are set out in the WIPO Convention, which established WIPO in 1967.

### The WIPO Academy

 It is a division of WIPO established in 1998. The WIPO Academy is the center of exce­llence for intellectual property (IP) education and training for WIPO Member States, in particular develo­ping countries, least developed countries (LDCs) and countries in transition. 

The Academy works to help build human capacity in IP, which is essential for innovation. Its four programs cover a rich portfolio of both general and specialized courses on IP, and cater to different target audiences. Courses combine fa­ ce-to-face and distance learning methodologies, and are taught by IP experts. 
 
 The aim of the Academic Institutions program is to support access to IP higher education, especially to participants from develo­ping countries, LDCs and countries in transition. One of the main means of achieving this aim is through the Joint Master's Programs on IP, offered in cooperation with selected academic institutions.

### The African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARll?O)

The African Regional Intellectual Property Organization ARIPO) is a intergovernmental organization es­tablished by the Lusaka Agreement in 1976. The main objective for establishing ARIPO is to pool resour­ces of the member states together, for the promotion, development, and use of intellectual property (IP) for economic development. Currently, ARIPO has 22 member states with·t headquarters in Harare, Zim­babwe.

Article Ill of the Lusaka Agreement mandates ARIPO to establish schemes for the training of staff in the administration of Intellectual Property laws, org,anize training seminars and other meetings on Intellectual Property matters and promote the exchange of ideas and experience as well as conduct research studies in the field of IP. Through the ARIPO Academy, the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization provides capacity-building activities for the development of Africa as a whole.

### WIPO & ARIPO

ln July 2006, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) held a Colloquium at the ARIPO Headquarters on
Intellectual Property (IP) education, training and research. During the Colloquium, the participants called for an emergency action plan to address the critical shortage of intellectual property professionals and ex­perts in Africa. They requested the WIPO Academy and ARIPO in cooperation with Universities in Africa to establish an academic programme at the level of a Master in Intellectual Property (MIP) Degree, in one of the Universities in the member states of ARIPO. It was felt that this approach would provide a pragma­ tic response to the need for enhancement of the human resources development in IP in Africa.
