An idea in someone’s mind is not intellectual property.</p><h3 name="6586" id="6586" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Tracing the Roots of Intellectual Property</strong></h3><h4 name="86ea" id="86ea" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The beginning.</strong></h4><p name="1b69" id="1b69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The first formal patent legal institutions were developed in the Republic of Venice in the mid-1400s. In fact, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_patent_law" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_patent_law" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">history of patents and patent law</a> is generally considered to have started with the Venetian Statute of 1474.</p><p name="b1aa" id="b1aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Patent_Statute" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Patent_Statute" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Venetian Statute of 1474</a> decreed that the inventors of new and useful devices would be protected from infringers and copiers for ten years so long as they disclosed the details of their inventions.</p><p name="c822" id="c822" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most Venetian patents were granted in the field of glass making, and when these glass makers emigrated to other countries in Europe, they sought similar protections from the local authorities. This is how the notion of patent rights, and their expression in patent legal systems, began to spread and gain acceptance throughout Europe.</p><h4 name="4026" id="4026" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The 16th Century</strong></h4><p name="9ca9" id="9ca9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">European countries made several other important innovations in their early patent systems. In the mid-1500s, France became the first to publish patent descriptions from inventors who chose to submit them.</p><p name="f25f" id="f25f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">English and French monarchs also used patents to stimulate invention and grant exclusive trade monopolies to those favoured by the court.</p><p name="6d71" id="6d71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the reign of Elizabeth I in the late1500s, patent monopolies were granted for trading in staples such as salt, soap, starch, iron, and paper which to favoured monopolists, enriching them while robbing the community which neither stimulated industrial growth nor facilitating new technological developments.</p><h4 name="ce13" id="ce13" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The 17th Century</strong></h4><p name="9bfa" id="9bfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The modern concept of Intellectual Property (IP) did not emerge until the 17th century, due to public outcry, when Elizabeth’s successor James I was forced to revoke these grants of trade monopolies in 1610.</p><p name="b3ac" id="b3ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And in 1624, the English Parliament passed the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Statute-of-Monopolies" data-href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Statute-of-Monopolies" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Statute of Monopolies</a>, limiting the ability of the monarch to grant monopolies to select/favoured individuals or companies. The Statute formally repealed the practice and henceforth restricted patent rights solely to new inventions which allowed inventors to freely market their inventions without fear of government interference.</p><p name="d423" id="d423" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was the first step towards the development of modern Intellectual Property law as it recognized that ideas and inventions could be owned by individuals. Henceforth, countries began establishing intellectual property laws to foster creativity and to make it possible for the inventor to reap the benefits of their ingenuity.</p><h4 name="f183" id="f183" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The 18th Century</strong></h4><p name="dcc3" id="dcc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">During this period, the United States and France adopted patent and copyright laws. These laws were designed to encourage creativity and innovation by giving creators the exclusive right to use their inventions and work for a certain period of time.</p><p name="6392" id="6392" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">England under the reign of Queen Anne (1702–1714) was the first to require inventors to submit a written description of their patent to “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">describe and ascertain the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.</em>”</p><p name="dd3f" id="dd3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1710, the British Parliament passed the <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3389#:~:text=It%20was%20enacted%20in%20the,any%20book%20already%20in%20print." data-href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3389#:~:text=It%20was%20enacted%20in%20the,any%20book%20already%20in%20print." class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Statute of Anne</a>, which established the first copyright law in the world. <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3389#:~:text=It%20was%20enacted%20in%20the,any%20book%20already%20in%20print." data-href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3389#:~:text=It%20was%20enacted%20in%20the,any%20book%20already%20in%20print." class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Statute of Anne</a> granted authors the exclusive right to print and publish their works for a period of 14 years. This law was later adopted by other countries and is considered to be the foundation of modern copyright law.</p><p name="3837" id="3837" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1729, France began to publish abbreviated digests of patent descriptions, but these were intermittent and subject to delays of up to 60 years after the patents were originally granted. As might be expected, this lack of regularity limited the technological knowledge sharing which is one of the great benefits of a patent system.</p><p name="22c1" id="22c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1790, the United States enacted the first federal copyright law. Modelled off Britain’s <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3389#:~:text=It%20was%20enacted%20in%20the,any%20book%20already%20in%20print." data-href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3389#:~:text=It%20was%20enacted%20in%20the,any%20book%20already%20in%20print." class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Statute of Anne</a>, this new law was relatively limited in scope, protecting books, maps, and charts and granted authors the exclusive right to publish their works for a period of fourteen(14) years with a renewal period of another 14 years. The law was later extended to include other forms of creative expression, such as music and art.</p><h4 name="b953" id="b953" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The 19th Century</strong></h4><p name="93e7" id="93e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There was a growing recognition of the importance of protecting Intellectual Property (IP) which led to the development of new forms of IP, such as patents and trademarks. Thus, the world’s two main IP treaties were adopted: the Paris Convention (1883) for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Berne Convention (1886) for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.</p><p name="dfeb" id="dfeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These treaties have been ratified by over 180 countries and form the basis of modern IP law.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4993" id="4993" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">In 1883, the world’s first international IP convention was held in Paris and the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/history.html#:~:text=1883%20%E2%80%93%20Paris%20Convention,are%20protected%20in%20other%20countries." data-href="https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/history.html#:~:text=1883%20%E2%80%93%20Paris%20Convention,are%20protected%20in%20other%20countries." class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paris Convention</a> was adopted, to facilitate the protection of Industrial Property.</li><li name="6a4f" id="6a4f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">In 1886, <a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/" data-href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Berne Convention</a> was adopted, at an international assembly held in the Swiss city of Bern by ten European countries with the goal to agree on a set of legal principles for the protection of original work.</li></ul><h4 name="6a66" id="6a66" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The 20th Century, To date</strong></h4><p name="850f" id="850f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In the 20th century, IP law continued to develop and in 1967, the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/history.html" data-href="https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/history.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) was established</a>, an international organization that promotes the protection of IP around the world.</p><p name="019e" id="019e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And in 1994, the Agreement on <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm" data-href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights</a> (TRIPS) was adopted.
