## Background

According to [Bret Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor), being a product manager at a large company is different from founding a startup. For one, you are judged differently. While, in theory, product managers are judged on the success of the products they work on, in practice, large companies also judge product managers on their ability to manage all the people and departments that have a stake in a product’s outcome.

That’s why so many engineers and product managers that come out of larger companies have trouble with the concept of leverage. They are effectively trained to care about low leverage activities because the bureaucracy that trained them values and rewards them.

The most successful engineers [Bret Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor) has work with, in his opinion, were the few that were able to see past these bureaucratic idiosyncrasies and recognize the one or two things that would really impact their product’s success. And the engineer that taught him the most about leverage is, without question, [Paul Buchheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit).

In Bret's submission, [Paul Buchheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit) more than any person he'd ever met, was willing to challenge conventional thinking, and completely changed [Bret Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor) perspective on engineering and product management.

Whenever they'd encounter a challenging technical problem, while Bret would ask _“How should we do this?”_ Paul would respond, often obnoxiously, _“Why do we need to do it at all?”_. At times, it almost seemed like Paul was lazy—given any sufficiently hard project, Paul would question the purpose of the project. But he was almost always right. Because, Unless the project was destined to make or break our nascent company, why spend our precious engineering resources on it?

## Introduction

Working more hours isn’t the most effective way to increase output as proudly embraced by the “nine-to-five” culture. In Fact, this culture of working endless hours is unnecessary and often abused by ineffective managers around our industry leading to decreased productivity and burnout with output even turning out to be negative.

In addition to being unnecessary, that aspect of this culture is one of the main things that prevents people from choosing long term careers in software engineering as it's unsustainable for people with families, and often creating, toxic and immature atmospheres at many companies.

Engineering is much more about leverage than programming ability, therefore managers and engineers need to continuously embrace “working smart” rather than “working hard” and after reading this book you and i can embrace Edmond’s philosophy and techniques to make work, daily tasks, businesses, companies and our careers more successful.

To be effective engineers, we need to be able to identify which activities produce more impact with smaller time investments. Not all work is created equal. Not all efforts, however well-intentioned, translate into impact.

## What Makes an Effective Engineer?

How do you measure an engineer’s effectiveness? Is it by the number of hours she works? The amount of effort he applies? The number of tasks the engineer completes? At the end of the day, a hard-working engineer who pours his/her energy into a feature whose schedule slips and that no one uses isn’t that effective. We’ve been that engineer before, as have many talented people I know.

Ultimately asking questions like, Will this individual or will i grow into a strong contributor on the team and effectively get things done? need to be asked more often by Managers, Engineers, Executives and other concerned parties.

Intuitively, we have some notion of which engineers we consider to be effective. They’re the people who get things done, ship products that users love, launch features that customers pay for, build tools that boost team productivity, and deploy systems that help companies scale. Effective Engineers produce results yet if they take too long to accomplish these tasks, then we might hesitate to call them effective.

They might be hard-working, but we would consider someone who produced the same results in less time and with fewer resources to be more effective. Effective engineers, therefore, also get things done efficiently but also efficiency alone doesn’t guarantee effectiveness.

Effective engineers focus on value and impact and know how to choose which results to deliver. He/She is defined by the rate at which they produces value per unit of time worked. This is exactly what leverage—a
concept that we’ll introduced in Chapter 1 of this book and revisited throughout this book—
captures.

There will always be more effectiveness techniques to learn. But what [Edmond Lau](https://twitter.com/edmondlau) developed is a powerful framework for reasoning about effectiveness as an Engineer that can be applied to any activity which he shares this in The Effective Engineer.

The book examines and describes what it means to be an effective engineer, and distills the key
lessons that [Edmond Lau](https://twitter.com/edmondlau) has learned over the years and also supplements the framework with actionable and tested strategies that any Engineer can use right away to become more effective.

Despite being a book for software engineers, you won’t find a single line of
code in The Effective Engineer. 

Whether you want to increase your impact on the world, get promoted more quickly, waste less time grinding away at mindless tasks, or work fewer hours without sacrificing results, [The Effective Engineer](https://www.effectiveengineer.com/book) although not a comprehensive guide for everything that can
help you grow as an Engineer, it will give you the tools you need, and provide you with a consistent framework—leverage—for navigating which skills might be good investments of your time.

Teaching and mentoring are [Edmond Lau](https://twitter.com/edmondlau)'s passions, and through this book he shares what he's learned with the rest of us.
