# Storytelling
Storytelling, intertwined with the development of mythologies,[2] predates writing. The earliest forms of storytelling were usually oral, combined with gestures and expressions.
[citation needed] 
Some archaeologists[which?] believe that rock art, in addition to a role in religious rituals, may have served as a form of storytelling for many[quantify] ancient cultures.
Storytelling uses words to create new worlds and experiences in a reader or listener's imagination. Storytelling can impact human emotions and can also lead people
to accept original ideas or encourage them to take action. Since storytelling can take so many forms, creating a good story can be challenging.

## What is storytelling?
Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, sometimes with improvisation, theatrics or embellishment. Every culture has its own stories or narratives, 
which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values.[1] Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, 
characters and narrative point of view. 
The term "storytelling" can refer specifically to oral storytelling but also broadly to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.
