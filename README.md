# blogposts
#### All my blogs from [medium](https://piusmwilson.medium.com/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@piusmwilson) and [DevCommunity](https://dev.to/piusmwilson).

I am an IT Engineer, with a deep enthusiasm for business technology development, professional growth, community outreach and meaningful connections. I value myself on having a sound technical background, built on a foundation of personal discipline and a goals-driven work ethic to take on assigned responsibilities while easily adapting to new roles.

My articles are centred around blogging, technical writing and storytelling and I value all feedback from my valued readers. I mostly write about Technology, African oral tradition (focusing mostly on Ugandan History), [Book Reviews](https://www.instagram.com/bukmasta/), and personal opinions on life.
