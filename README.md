## Storytelling

Dear Reader

This a space where I write about Business, Technology, African literature both oral & written, as well as occasional book reviews on amazing reads I found insightful, entertaining and worth recommending.

Storytelling 

Storytelling in Africa has been manifested in many ways and was used to serve many purposes. It was used to interpret the universe, resolve natural and physical phenomena, teach morals, maintain cultural values, pass on methods of survival, and to praise God.


This is a collection of storytelling material researched, curated and created for purposes of learning, entertainment, referencing and informing, provided on an "as is" basis with no guarantees of completeness, accuracy, usefulness or timeliness and as such any useful suggestions, comments and reference for further improvement on any errors or omissions in the content are welcome.

## Disclaimer

The main purpose of all writing here is purely for research, publication and learning purposes. All and any comments, advice or suggestions are welcome.
I strongly believe as a Tech Engineer learning starts with sharing what you've learned and benefited from other contributor's resources.
