# **Introduction**

**Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** is a set of tools, practices, and processes applied to discover, validate, verify, monitor, and evaluate a piece of software to ensure its quality. 

SQA stretches through all software development phases depending on the team, industry, or practices being followed and should not be confused with software testing. —Testing is a big part of **Software Quality Assurance**, but it is not, by any means, the only part of it.

 The purpose of SQA is to make sure that all software engineering processes are monitored and comply with defined standards.

This is achieved by incorporating software development processes starting from defining requirements to coding until release/launch where the key goal is to ensure the quality of the software product.

# **Who is a Software Quality Assurance Engineer(SQA)?**

A Software Quality Assurance Engineer is the human resource who carries out software quality Assurance in the software development process to ensure the quality of the final product.

This can include processes such as requirements gathering and documentation, source code control, code review, change management, configuration management, release management, and the actual testing of the software among other things.

#### Software Quality Assurance roles/titles in the business technology industry include;- 
* Quality Assurance Analyst (QA Analyst), 
* Quality Assurance Engineer (QA Engineer), 
* Software Quality Assurance Engineer (SQA Engineer), 
* Software Quality Engineer, 
* Quality Assurance Director (QA Director),
* Software Quality Engineer, 
* Product Assurance Engineer, 
* Software Test Engineer.

# **Core skills needed for becoming a good QA engineer**

#### **Attention to detail**

The role of a QA engineer involves being detail-oriented and thorough to spot issues or discrepancies in quality standards set for the product.

#### **Good communication**

QA engineers will be communicating with stakeholders, management, and developers for the product. Effective and clear communication between all parties involved is really important for the development process of a product.

#### **Good time management**

Since a QA engineer will have to balance multiple tasks throughout the day, it is important to have strong time management skills to ensure that you stay productive and can meet your deadlines.

#### **Problem-solving skills**

Throughout the life cycle of a product, issues will arise. QA engineers must have strong problem-solving skills and can develop a plan to solve those issues.

#### **Strong listening skills**

A good QA engineer not only needs to be able to communicate but also listen to their development team, management, and stakeholders to ensure the successful launch of the product.

#### **The ability to write a test plan**

A test plan is a document detailing the objectives and testing processes that will be applied to the software product. QA engineers will work with other developers and stakeholders to develop this testing strategy.

#### **An understanding of test automation tools and manual testing practices**

It is helpful for QA engineers to be familiar with different automated testing tools like Selenium. They will also need to know how to effectively manually test products to identify bugs.

#### **Strong understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle**

A good QA engineer should understand the full life cycle of software products to effectively plan and test them.

# **Other Qualities good Software Quality Assurance Engineers and Testers Should have.**

#### **Problem Sensitivity**

The ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong. It does not involve solving the problem, only recognizing there is a problem.

#### **Deductive Reasoning**

The ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.

#### **Inductive Reasoning**

The ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (including finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events).

#### **Written Comprehension**

The ability to read and understand information and ideas presented in writing.

#### **Oral Comprehension**

The ability to listen to and understand information and ideas presented through spoken words and sentences.

#### **Oral Expression**

The ability to communicate information and ideas in speaking so others will understand.

#### **Written Expression**

The ability to communicate information and ideas in writing so others will understand.

#### **Information Ordering**

The ability to arrange things or actions in a certain order or pattern according to a specific rule or set of rules (e.g., patterns of numbers, letters, words, pictures, mathematical operations).

#### **Near Vision**

The ability to see details at close range (within a few feet of the observer).

# **What SQA Engineers do.**

* Develop or specify standards, methods, or procedures to determine product quality or release readiness.

* SQAs often design and develop and execute software test plans, and scripts in order to identify software problems and their causes.

* Develop testing programs that address areas such as database impacts, software scenarios, regression testing, negative testing, error or bug retests, or usability.

* Plan test schedules or strategies in accordance with project scope or delivery dates.

* Document software defects, using a bug-tracking system, and report defects to software developers as well as Identify, analyze, and document problems with program function, output, online screen, or content as well as document test procedures to ensure replicability and compliance with standards.

* Participate in product design reviews to provide input on functional requirements, product designs, schedules, or potential problems as well as conduct software compatibility tests with programs, hardware, operating systems, or network environments.

* Install, maintain, or configure software production, training & UAT environments to allow testing of software performance.

* Test system modifications to prepare for implementation and review software documentation to ensure technical accuracy, compliance, or completeness, or to mitigate risks.

* Provide feedback and recommendations to developers on software usability and functionality.

* Monitor program performance, identify program deviance from standards, and suggest modifications to ensure compliance, efficiency, and problem-free operations.

* Conduct historical analyses of test results, update automated test scripts to ensure testing accuracy, and design or develop automated testing tools.

* Investigate customer problems referred to by technical support and collaborate with field staff or customers to evaluate or diagnose these problems and recommend possible solutions.

* Perform initial debugging procedures by reviewing configuration files, logs, or code pieces to determine the breakdown source.

* Monitor bug resolution efforts and track successes by creating or maintaining databases of known test defects.

* Evaluate or recommend software for testing, bug tracking and also coordinate user or third-party testing.


# **Some SQA Engineer’s best practices**

* Set testing goals and requirements.

* Establish a clear workflow.

* Always check industry standards compliance.

* Combine automated and manual testing.

* Implement risk-based testing.

* Perform frequent regression testing. (Regression cycle)

* Set up the right environments; -Talk to end-users and simulate their environment, Mimic the developer environment this was QAs and Developers use the same environment for running tests. (Feedback and user acceptance is very critical)

# Conclusion

Software Quality Assurance is very key for a lot of companies especially those rolling out software products as it ensures, quality adherence according to a set of agreed-upon standards.

Software Quality Assurance (SQA) engineers and testers have an eye for detail and are committed to improving the performance of the products (e.g Software) they work on by ensuring that the software packages shipped out meet or exceed the customer's expectations in performance and value.

SQA Engineers carry out Software Quality Assurance through tasks like software design, writing source code, control of source code, reviewing code, configuration management, change management, program testing, integration of software, and release management process.
